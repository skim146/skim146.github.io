My research is in the field of mathematical analysis. By cold-emailing professors to . I 

I proved the following bound:

$$\beta_d(\pi/2) \geq 1$$ for all $$d \in (0,\infty)$$ where $$x=\pi^2/d$$ and 
$$\pi \beta_d \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) =2x\coth\left( \frac{x}{2}\right)-x-4x\sinh(x)\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{\cosh(4nx)-\cosh(x)}.$$
Furthermore, I proved that $$\beta_d(\pi/2) is strictly increasing in $$x$$ for all $$x>0$$.
