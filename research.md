My research is in the field of mathematical analysis. After finishing the reading group for Evans, I wanted some more hands-on experiences with PDEs. Hence, I thought that the course on scalar conservation laws at the [Queens University Summer School](https://mast.queensu.ca/~qmss24/) would be the perfect opportunity to grow my analysis knowledge while also exposing myself to other interesting subjects like machine learning and algebraic curves and Riemann surfaces. Indeed, during the summer of $$2024$$, I attended this summer workshop as a fully-funded participant, while also doing my own independent reading into *The Mathematical Analysis of the Incompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes Equations: An Introduction* by V. Vicol and J. Bedrossian. After finishing the course and chapter $$1$$ of the aforementioned text, I started reaching out to professors to see if I could apply my skills to research and gain a deeper experience working with pure mathematics.

I connected with Prof. Javier Gomez-Serrano in late July of $$2024$$, and I was able to work on a conjecture that arose from the Hilbert transform and the fluid mechanics of water waves. Over the course of a few months, I found strong connections between the conjecture and the Jacobi Theta functions, and I was eventually able to show that the result was true. This resulted in the paper *A note on the periodic Hilbert Transform on a strip*, which is to be submitted to a journal soon.

Specifically, I proved the following bound:

$$\beta_d(\pi/2) \geq 1$$ for all $$d \in (0,\infty)$$ where $$x=\pi^2/d$$ and 

$$\pi \beta_d \left( \frac{\pi}{2} \right) =2x\coth\left( \frac{x}{2}\right)-x-4x\sinh(x)\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{\cosh(4nx)-\cosh(x)}.$$

Furthermore, I showed that $$\beta_d(\pi/2)$$ is strictly increasing in $$x$$ for all $$x>0$$. In fact, I found that the function had the following expression in terms of the [Jacobi Theta $$3$$ function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theta_function):

$$\beta_d\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)=\vartheta_3^2\left(0,\exp\left(-\frac{\pi^2}{x}\right)\right).$$
