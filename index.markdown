Hi. I'm a high school senior living in Korea. I'm interested in mathematics and science, specifically fields in analysis. I've recently done research in analysis under the guidance of a professor, and managed to prove a small conjectured lower bound via Jacobi Theta functions. I've participated in various reading groups for mathematical texts like G. Folland's *Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and their Applications*, and am looking to delve deeper into how advanced mathematics can be applied to real-world situations. Although I've been really into analysis during high school, I'm eager to branch out and learn more, especially fields like algebraic geometry and number theory. I've recently I'm planning on studying mathematics in the US after I graduate.

My website will be where I document my progress in mathematics and also upload posts on anything I find interesting, whether that be based on a paper I'm writing or just something cool I found in a textbook I'm reading. Feel free contact me for anything, my socials are linked in the author profile of the website.
