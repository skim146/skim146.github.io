Hi. I'm a high school junior living in Korea. I'm interested in mathematics and science, specifically fields in analysis, geometry, and topology. I'm currently learning algebraic topology in an online reading group, and am looking to delve deeper into fields like topological data analysis and the applications of advanced mathematics to real-world situations. I hope to study mathematics in college and am eager to learn more.

My website will be where I document my progress in mathematics and also upload posts on anything I find interesting, whether that be based on a paper I'm writing or just something cool I found in a textbook I'm reading. Feel free contact me for anything, my socials are linked in the author profile of the website.
