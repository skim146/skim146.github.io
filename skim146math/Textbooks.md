Most of the mathematics I know was learned through self-studing textbooks, with the exception of algebraic topology, measure theory, and group theory, which were learned in classes (which had an assigned text nonetheless). The textbooks I go through will be documented, and for each book, I will add a short summary/review on what I felt reading the text. 

I am currently learning:

- **Algebraic Topology**
    - *Algebraic Topology* - A. Hatcher

I started self-studying around December $$2021$$, and the following describes my current accumulated knowledge so far, and my experiences with the textbooks that I’ve read since then.

My background:

- **Geometric Measure Theory**
    - *Geometric Integration Theory* - S. Krantz and H. Parks
        
        A well-written introduction to geometric measure theory that’s perhaps a more pedagogically advantageous alternative to Simon’s text. In the later chapters, the proofs are mostly the same as Simon, to the point where the presentation of definitions/theorems/lemmas and the progression of the texts seem identical (especially in the chapter on currents). Nevertheless, Krantz and Parks present the highlights of GMT in a relatively digestible manner, while only assuming background in basic measure theory and multivariable calculus (it even reviews all the necessary concepts). One notable downside is the lack of exercises.
        
    - *Introduction to Geometric Measure Theory* - L. Simon
        
        A more encyclopedic text than KP, covering the same content with additional topics. Covers both currents and varifolds, but I only read the chapter on currents. I recommend supplementing this book with another book such as KP, as it is very terse and leaves many details to the reader. Still much more readable than Federer’s classical text on GMT though. Again, it lacks exercises so one would need to find another source for those.
        
- **Measure Theory**
    - *Real Analysis: Modern Techniques and their Applications* - G. Folland
        
        Read through the first three chapters and part of the seventh chapter. IMO a very well written text, and it’s popularity within university classes speaks for itself. Not too terse and provides motivation where necessary, and overall not too difficult to understand. Covers results on abstract measures first such as Caratheodory’s theorem, then segues into the Lebesgue construction, which IMO is the best progression, unlike what is presented in something like Stein and Shakarchi Volume $$3$$. The first two chapters were amazing, but some of the proofs in the third chapter were slightly difficult to read, such as those for the Radon-Nikodym theorem and Lebesgue Decomposition theorem. Exercises are great and fun.
        
- **Real Analysis**
    - *Principles of Mathematical Analysis* - W. Rudin
        
        The classic Baby Rudin. Not much to say about it that hasn’t been said before, so I’ll describe my own personal experience reading it. The first two chapters were absolutely brutal, as nothing I had read before was this terse, but after getting past this point, the book became actually readable in the third chapter. From chapters $$3$$ to $$7$$, Baby Rudin was enjoyable and of course, the exercises were great. For those who are attempting this book, I highly recommend using [this supplement](https://math.berkeley.edu/~gbergman/ug.hndts/m104_Rudin_exs.pdf), it helped a lot in choosing which exercises to do.
        
    - *Analysis I* - H. Amann and J. Escher
        
        I read this after finishing Baby Rudin, and it was a great review. Covers everything from a more modern perspective, with algebraic and topological elements mixed in, contrasting Rudin’s vehement metric space approach to analysis. Very readable, albeit a bit long, and has a much wider coverage than Rudin, except for the fact that it covers only up until differentiation (*Analysis II* by the same authors covers integration). Includes words like “Banach space” and “Hausdorff”, but the high-level coverage of introductory analysis is not to say it is difficult (in fact, I found it easier to read that Rudin). The exercises were great, though they weren’t at the level of Baby Rudin.
        
- **Complex Analysis**
    - *A Course in Complex Analysis and Riemann Surfaces* - W. Schlag
        
        Only read the first chapter so I can’t speak on much, but from what I’ve seen, a very concise and high-level treatment of complex analysis. I went in with a background in measure theory and differential forms, so it was relatively readable, yet I still struggled in the section about Möbius transformations. Requires some knowledge of differential geometry and topology going in, and Schlag expects the reader to recognize things like one-point compactification and Stokes’s theorem within the first twenty pages. However, definitely a decent read if you know a lot of math but little complex analysis and want to learn it from an advanced viewpoint.
        
- **Calculus**
    - *Calculus: Early Transcendentals* - J. Stewart
        
        Don’t remember much about this one, learned up to differentiation here then got bored. The epitome of the standard “calculus cookbook”, but of course the myriad of exercises is nice for someone who has never seen calculus before. The first textbook I actually self-studied from, but certainly not the best one I’ve ever read. Great at what it does, but nothing more.
        
    - *Calculus, Volume 1* - T. Apostol
        
        Halfway between introductory analysis and introductory calculus. Well written and motivated, but does integration before differentiation for some reason. A bit weird in that aspect, but eventually culminates to be a decent coverage of calculus. Great for self-studying in high school, but I’d imagine it’d have present some problems if you tried to use it to follow along with a standard calculus class. Exercises are amazing, probably the best part of the book.
        
- **Group Theory**
    - *Abstract Algebra* - D. Dummit and R. Foote
        
        Read the first two chapters and a bit of the third before I got bored and switched to the free text offered by my group theory class. Overall a very slow and encyclopedic text that is very easy to read. The book is slow to the point where it is impossible not to get bored while reading through it. Has many exercises at the end of every section and these are probably the best part of the book.
        
- **Linear Algebra**
    - *Linear Algebra* - K. Hoffman and R. Kunze
        
        I first learned linear algebra from this book and *Linear Algebra Done Wrong* by Treil. I don’t remember too much about this book since it has been over a while since I read it, but I recall the treatment of determinants being an annoying watered-down rendition of the multilinear perspective on determinants. The text is fine otherwise.
        
    - *Abstract Linear Algebra* - M. Curtis
        
        One of my favorites for linear algebra. Has a healthy mix of computation and theory, and assumes some algebra background (you should know what groups are). Proceeds with the exterior algebra construction of the determinant, which was the first perspective that made the determinant click with me. Otherwise a concise yet digestible text that could be read by one who is acquainted with the rudiments of linear algebra but wants a quick review or to expand their knowledge.
        

For most of $$2022$$ and $$2023$$ I’ve been more interested in analysis than any other field, but my interests are now shifting more toward geometry and topology. The following are topics I want to study in the future.

My reading list:

- **Topological Data Analysis and Persistent Homology**
    - *Computational Topology: An Introduction* - H. Edelsbrunner and J. Harer
- **Commutative Algebra**
    - *Introduction to Commutative Algebra* - M. Atiyah and I. Macdonald
- **Algebraic Geometry**
    - *Algebraic Geometry* - R. Hartshorne
    - *The Rising Sea: Foundations of Algebraic Geometry* - R. Vakil
- **Complex Geometry**
    - *Complex Analytic and Differential Geometry* - JP. Demailly
    - *Principles of Algebraic Geometry* - P. Griffiths and J. Harris
- **Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology**
