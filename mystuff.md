This page stores some of my mathematical projects. I upload my personal projects, any solutions to problem sets assigned in my classes, and other miscellaneous math related stuff I’ve compiled over the years. Note that these are authentic documents and may (and will) contain mathematical mistakes, especially my homework solutions. Please excuse the crankery.

## Personal Projects:

- [*Optimization of a Bullet*](/assets/pdfs/Optimization_of_a_Bullet.pdf)
    
    - I analyze the ideal shape of a bullet to minimize the effect of air resistance given certain assumptions. My first interdisciplinary encounter and it was a fun experience, worked on it over a few months and became acquainted with optimization, specifically Lagrange multipliers, the KKT conditions, and the calculus of variations. 

- [*Optimization of a Bullet Poster*](/assets/pdfs/Optimization_of_a_Bullet_Poster.pdf)

    - A poster adaptation of the above that I presented at the [Canadian Applied and Industrial Mathematics Society](https://caims.ca/) (CAIMS) annual conference during the summer of $$2024$$.

## Expository Papers:

- [*Currents in Geometric Measure Theory*](/assets/pdfs/Currents_in_Geometric_Measure_Theory.pdf)
    
    - My first actually developed work of mathematics. I present the compactness theorem for integer-multiplicity rectifiable currents to an audience who is not yet familiar with (geometric) measure theory and use it to provide a solution to Plateau’s problem.
    
- [*Maximal Functions and their Applications in Ergodic Theory*](/assets/pdfs/Maxfuncerg.pdf)
    
    - Presents a known proof of the pointwise ergodic theorem using maximal functions. Written up for a measure theory reading group I was in.
